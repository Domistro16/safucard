# Safucard

This is a dApp project that showcases how to integrate Alchemyâ€™s APIs to retrieve a walletâ€™s BEP-20 token data which includes the whale status, the first and most recent tokens held, and address age based on its first transaction on a Slick Card Design and is optionally minted as an NFT.

## How To Setup

1. Clone The Repo

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Domistro16/safucard.git
   cd safucard
```

2. Install Dependencies

```bash
   cd SafuServer
   npm install
   cd ../Scorecard_NFT
   npm install
   cd ../scorecard-frontend
   npm install
   cd ..
```

3. Configure .env variables

   Copy .env.example variables to .env using the following command:

   ```bash
   cp SafuServer/.env.example SafuServer/.env
   cp Scorecard_NFT/.env.example Scorecard_NFT/.env
   cp scorecard-frontend/.env.example scorecard-frontend/.env
   ```

   Then update your .env variables for each folder

   Scorecard_NFT:

   This includes your RPC_URL and your Deployer's Private key

   ```bash
   API_URL=
   DEPLOYER_KEY=
   ```

   SafuServer:

   This includes your Alchemy Key and your Pinata Gateway URL and Pinata JWT

   ```bash
   ALCHEMY_KEY=
   GATEWAY_URL=
   JWT=
   ```

   scorecard-frontend:

   This includes the NFT Contract Address and the API Url to your Server

   ```bash
   CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x2B20F646CEdB8D40f2a37358A3b712ced3D5B294
   VITE_API_URL=
   ```

4. Get Your Alchemy Key:

- Go to https://www.alchemy.com/
- Create an account
- Go to your Dashboard and create a new Project for BSC Testnet
- Copy Your API Key and update your .env variable

5. Start the Express Server

   ```bash
   cd SafuServer
   npm run build
   npm run dev
   ```

6. Deploy/Use Already Deployed Testnet Contract

   You can choose to deply a new NFT contract:

   ```bash
   cd Scorecard_NFT
   npx hardhat compile
   npx hardhat run ./scripts/deploy.ts
   ```

   Or Use the Already Deployed Contract:
   
   ```bash
   CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x2B20F646CEdB8D40f2a37358A3b712ced3D5B294
   ```

## How To Interact With Frontend

1. Run the Development Server
   ```bash
   cd scorecard-frontend
   npm run dev
   ```
2. Connect your Web3 wallet using the **Connect Wallet** button.
3. Enter your BNB wallet address in the input field.
4. Click **Search** to fetch scorecard data and generate your SafuCard.
5. Click **Download** or **Fullscreen** to preview or save the image.
6. Optionally, click **Mint NFT** to upload to IPFS and mint the card as an NFT.

## ðŸ“¡ API / Endpoints

| Path                      | Method | Description                             |
| ------------------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------- |
| `/api/address/${address}` | GET    | Returns the wallet's safu erc20 details |

## Notes

- Make sure your smart contract is deployed and funded.
- Backend must handle Pinata upload endpoints securely.
- This project uses Chainlink's price feeds for pricing NFT mint.
